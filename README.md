Machine Learning Internship Projects — Cognifiz Technologies
Welcome to my repository containing the projects I completed during my Machine Learning internship at Cognifiz Technologies. This repository hosts 4 tasks involving a restaurant dataset with various ML applications including prediction, suggestions, and recommendations.

📝 Overview
During the internship, I worked on multiple tasks centered around a restaurant dataset to solve real-world problems using machine learning techniques. The key tasks included:

Predictive modeling using regression and classification algorithms

Implementing recommendation systems to suggest relevant items/offers

Generating data-driven suggestions to improve restaurant operations

Applying evaluation metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE), accuracy, and others to assess model performance

Using various data visualization techniques for exploratory data analysis and result presentation
